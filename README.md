Hello,

This is a very simple Todo list utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS. The main purpose of this microproject is to learn basic DOM manipulation utilizing JS. I learned about querying the DOM, attaching event listeners, working with nodes, modifying the classes and attributes, and modifying the DOM. 

I hope to return to this project and make it more advanced as I learn more JS concepts. Overall, this project took around ~3 hrs.

To work this project, just have all the above files in a single local directory, and locally host it.
